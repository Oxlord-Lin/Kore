    "# Kore Fleets - Rule Based Agent 👾\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes a simplified version of the agent I used to place 6th in the Beta competetion. The agent is based on the provided starter bot (https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/kore_fleets/kore_fleets.py). This notebook is aimed to help people get started in the competetion and potentially provide some initial insights into the game! It is still a work in progress so please let me know if you spot any bugs or have any code improvements to recommend. If you find it useful give it a thumbs up 🤙\n",

    "\n",
    "[Helpers 🤝](#first-bullet)\n",
    " This consists of extra helper functions. This includes simple functions to calculate the shortest flight path between two points and the total number of ships for a given player. It also provides functions to calculate the maximum length of a flight plan given a fleet size (and vice versa) as well as a function to calulate the collection rate for a given fleet size. Examples of these calculations can be found in the kore rules (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/overview/kore-rules) but these functions provide precise calculations for all fleet sizes. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The simple agent works by checking if it should take the following actions. The priority of these actions are ordered as shown below. This is executed for each shipyard independently.\n",
    "    \n",
    "[Defend 🛡](#second-bullet) If a large enemy fleet is near a shipyard the main objective is to defend. This is done by building more ships if possible.\n",
    "  \n",
    "[Attack 🧨](#third-bullet) If a shipyard has enough ships to attack a nearby enemy shipyard it should attack or start building more ships to attack.\n",
    "    \n",
    "[Build 🧱](#fourth-bullet) If the player has enough Kore and the shipyards `spawn maximum` is large enough the shipyard should expand. This expansion is to a nearby location maximising surrounding kore but away from enemy shipyards.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mine ⛏](#fith-bullet) The agent uses 3 mining tactics..\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. A simple 'circle'. This will have a flight path of length 7 (e.g. `\"N5E5W5S\"`) requiring a fleet size of 21.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. A 'rectangle'. This is similar as above but has a gap of 0 on two sides. This allows the flight path and, as a result, the fleet size to be much smaller. For example the flight path `\"NE5WS\"` (length 5) only requires a fleet size of 8.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The final route is an 'L' shape (I first saw this in the beta by @robga). This involves leaving the shipyard in an L shape and coming back along the same route. An example fligth path is `\"N6E6W6S\"` which requires a fleet size of 21.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The agent looks at all possible mining routes and calculates which path mines the most kore per ship in the fleet.\n",
    "    \n",
    "[Spawn Ships 🚀](#sixth-bullet) If the shipyard has enough kore it will spawn the maximum number of ships.\n",
    "   \n",
    "[Replay and submission 🎥](#seventh-bullet) This shows the agent vs a baseline bot."
